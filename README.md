# Northpoint: Single-player open-world RPG built with Unreal Engine 5

This project, built with **Unreal Engine 5** using a combination of **Blueprints** and **C++**, along with a variety of models, textures, animations, and other assets, delivers a fully developed systemic gameplay layer. It allows players to freely explore the world, interact with its inhabitants, develop their character, and engage in real-time encounters — creating an experience centered on exploration, presence, and meaningful player agency.

## Features

- **A detailed, atmospheric environment** inspired by Nordic medieval aesthetics, featuring natural landscapes and a coherent, lived-in world.
- **An advanced movement and interaction system** with multiple movement states and seamless interaction with objects and the environment.
- **A dynamic combat system** supporting melee, ranged, and unarmed fighting, along with defensive and reactive mechanics.
- **Skill-based progression** where attributes and abilities grow through gameplay, allowing players to define their playstyle.
- **AI-driven NPC behaviour** with individual routines, world awareness, and situational decision-making that makes characters feel independent and alive.
- **Branching dialogue and quest systems** with choice-driven conversations, flexible quest structures, and an integrated journal.
- **An interactive map and navigation system** for natural orientation in the open world.
- **A comprehensive save/load system** that preserves world state, character progress, inventory, NPC statuses, and environmental changes.

## Getting Started

The playable build can be downloaded from the [Links](#links) section. To play, download the ZIP, extract it, and run Northpoint.exe. No installation is required.

Northpoint is developed for PC and is intended to run on hardware roughly comparable to the development setup. The game is lightweight but relies on responsive input and stable framerate for the best experience.
